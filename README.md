Running The Project
Straight forward, the solution is configured to run multiple projects (backend and front end).
When you run the solution, both projects are launched.

The project although runnable, is largely uncompleted.

The business logic is largely Domain Driven Design. I think the only thing I didnt implement is theb Loyalty Points.

When I started, I followed a Test Driven Design, until I realized I was not getting as much time as I needed to work on the project.

I intended to use Message Based Architecture (Learning RabbitMQ), but I had no time and I had not tried it before now. I was also concerned about best practices and anti-patterns, so I decided to leave it at the last minute and go the REST way.


I would have refactored, simplify some of the design further, complete the development.

So, here we are.
